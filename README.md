you want a bit of realism? well here you go


this adds a addon to geofs FOR FUEL
all calculations are done from flight duration
please plan flight correctly and check hours and minutes
after fuel has been exhausted engines will turn off and emergency will be declared
an ai will say you have been cleared to land at any airports in sight
if not...
well rest in peace
your dead.
